# File Upload Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Issues Identified

### 1. **Heavy Processing During Upload**
- **Comprehensive data clearing**: Clearing all caches and session data on every upload
- **Synchronous processing**: File processing happens in the main thread
- **Multiple DataFrame operations**: Complex data transformations during load
- **Product database integration**: Blocking strain matching during file load

### 2. **Memory and Cache Inefficiencies**
- **Cache clearing**: All caches cleared on every upload (inefficient)
- **Session data clearing**: Unnecessary clearing of session data
- **No intelligent caching**: Repeated processing of same data
- **Memory leaks**: Large objects not properly cleaned up

### 3. **Excel Processing Bottlenecks**
- **Large file parsing**: `pd.read_excel()` is slow for large files
- **String processing**: Regex operations on every row
- **DataFrame operations**: Multiple `.apply()` calls on large datasets
- **Categorical conversion**: Converting all columns to categorical types

## Immediate Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Upload Process Optimization (Immediate Impact)

#### 1.1 **Asynchronous Processing**
- Move heavy processing to background threads
- Return immediate response to user
- Use progress tracking for user feedback

#### 1.2 **Selective Cache Management**
- Only clear relevant caches, not all caches
- Preserve user session data
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation

#### 1.3 **Optimized Data Loading**
- Use chunked reading for large files
- Implement lazy loading for heavy operations
- Optimize DataFrame operations

### Phase 2: Memory and Performance Optimizations

#### 2.1 **Memory Management**
- Implement proper garbage collection
- Use memory-efficient data structures
- Optimize categorical data types

#### 2.2 **Caching Strategy**
- Implement intelligent caching with TTL
- Cache expensive operations
- Use LRU cache for frequently accessed data

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Optimize Upload Endpoint
- Reduce synchronous processing
- Implement background processing
- Optimize cache clearing

### Step 2: Optimize Excel Processing
- Implement chunked reading
- Optimize DataFrame operations
- Add progress tracking

### Step 3: Memory Optimization
- Implement proper cleanup
- Optimize data structures
- Add memory monitoring

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Upload Time Reduction
- **Current**: 30-60 seconds for large files
- **Target**: 5-10 seconds for initial response
- **Background**: Complete processing in 15-30 seconds

### Memory Usage Reduction
- **Current**: 121.47 MB for 2,358 records
- **Target**: 80-100 MB for same dataset
- **Optimization**: 20-30% reduction

### User Experience Improvements
- **Immediate feedback**: Upload response in 2-3 seconds
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress updates
- **Non-blocking**: UI remains responsive during processing
