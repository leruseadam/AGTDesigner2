# Product Strain Font Sizing Fix Summary

## Issue
Product strain was getting the same font size as brand (16pt) instead of the intended 1pt font size in the double template.

## Problem Description
The double template was rendering product strain with 16pt font size instead of the configured 1pt font size, making it appear the same size as the brand name.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the multi-marker processing logic in `_process_paragraph_for_markers_template_specific` method. While the font sizing functions were correctly returning 1pt for the `PRODUCTSTRAIN` marker, the multi-marker processing was not properly applying different font sizes to different markers.

The `PRODUCTSTRAIN` marker was missing from the special handling sections, so it was falling through to default behavior and getting the same font size as other content in the paragraph.

## Solution
Added special handling for the `PRODUCTSTRAIN` marker in the multi-marker processing logic to ensure it gets the correct 1pt font size.

### Changes Made

**File**: `src/core/generation/template_processor.py`
**Method**: `_process_paragraph_for_markers_template_specific`
**Lines**: 1080-1085

**Added**:
```python
# Special handling for ProductStrain marker - always use 1pt font
if marker_name in ('PRODUCTSTRAIN', 'STRAIN'):
    for run in paragraph.runs:
        # Only apply 1pt font to runs that contain strain content
        if marker_data['content'] in run.text:
            set_run_font_size(run, get_font_size_by_marker(marker_data['content'], 'PRODUCTSTRAIN', self.template_type, self.scale_factor))
    continue
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script `test_strain_font_sizing.py` that verifies:
1. Font sizing functions correctly return 1pt for strain content
2. Template processor correctly applies 1pt font to strain content
3. Only strain content gets 1pt font while other content maintains proper font sizes
4. Spacing and line breaks are preserved

## Results
✅ **Before**: All content had 16pt font size (lineage, brand, strain)  
✅ **After**: 
- Lineage: 16pt font size ✓
- Brand: 16pt font size ✓  
- Strain: 1pt font size ✓

## Final Output
The double template now correctly renders content with proper font sizing:
```
•  HYBRID          (16pt - lineage)
Test Brand 1       (16pt - brand)
Test Strain 1      (1pt - strain)
```

## Impact
- Product strain now correctly displays with 1pt font size as intended
- Lineage and brand maintain their proper font sizes
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing templates
- No changes required to template files or data processing
