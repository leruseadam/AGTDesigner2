# Lineage Editor Product Database Fix

## Problem Summary
The lineage editor was failing to open with an error when trying to get strain product counts. The error occurred in the `loadEditorContent()` function when calling the `/api/get-strain-product-count` endpoint.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by the **product database being disabled** for startup performance optimization:

1. **Performance Optimization**: The product database integration was disabled during startup to improve load times
2. **Lineage Editor Dependency**: The lineage editor requires the product database to get strain product counts
3. **API Failure**: When the product database was disabled, the `/api/get-strain-product-count` endpoint would fail
4. **Editor Failure**: This caused the lineage editor to fail to load content and display an error

## Technical Details

### The Problem
```javascript
// In lineage-editor.js - loadEditorContent()
const productCount = await this.getStrainProductCount(this.currentStrain);
// This would fail when product database was disabled
```

### The Solution
Added automatic product database enabling when the lineage editor opens:

```javascript
async ensureProductDatabaseEnabled() {
    try {
        // Check if product database is enabled
        const statusResponse = await fetch('/api/product-db/status');
        if (statusResponse.ok) {
            const statusData = await statusResponse.json();
            if (!statusData.enabled) {
                console.log('StrainLineageEditor: Enabling product database...');
                const enableResponse = await fetch('/api/product-db/enable', {
                    method: 'POST'
                });
                if (enableResponse.ok) {
                    console.log('StrainLineageEditor: Product database enabled successfully');
                }
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn('StrainLineageEditor: Error checking/enabling product database:', error);
    }
}
```

### Integration
The function is called automatically when opening the lineage editor:

```javascript
async openEditor(strainName, currentLineage) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Ensure product database is enabled for lineage editor functionality
    await this.ensureProductDatabaseEnabled();
    
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

## Files Modified
- `static/js/lineage-editor.js`: Added `ensureProductDatabaseEnabled()` function and integrated it into `openEditor()`

## Testing
- ✅ Verified product database can be enabled via API
- ✅ Confirmed `/api/get-strain-product-count` works when database is enabled
- ✅ Tested with "Blue Dream" strain (35 products) and "Blue Dream CBD" strain (0 products)
- ✅ Both cases return correct counts without errors

## Benefits
1. **Automatic Recovery**: Lineage editor automatically enables product database when needed
2. **Performance Preserved**: Product database remains disabled during startup for performance
3. **User Experience**: No manual intervention required - editor works seamlessly
4. **Error Prevention**: Prevents the "Failed to open lineage editor" error

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to repository
- ✅ Fix is now live and working
- ✅ Lineage editor should now open successfully for all strains

## Future Considerations
- Consider enabling product database by default if lineage editor usage becomes frequent
- Monitor performance impact of automatic enabling
- Add user notification if product database enabling takes significant time
