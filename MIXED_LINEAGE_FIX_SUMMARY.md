# MIXED Lineage Fix for Classic Types - Complete Solution

## Problem Description

The application was incorrectly assigning "MIXED" lineage to classic product types (flower, pre-roll, concentrate, solventless concentrate, vape cartridge, rso/co2 tankers). This was happening in multiple places:

1. **SQLite Database**: The database contained "MIXED" lineage values for classic strains
2. **Lineage Persistence Logic**: The application was pulling "MIXED" lineage from the database and applying it to classic types
3. **File Loading**: When files were loaded, "MIXED" lineage was being assigned to classic types
4. **Database Updates**: The application was saving "MIXED" lineage back to the database for classic types

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
- The SQLite database containing incorrect "MIXED" lineage values for classic strains
- The lineage persistence logic not properly validating lineage values for classic types
- Missing validation in the database update functions
- No immediate correction of "MIXED" lineage during file loading

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### 1. **SQLite Database Cleanup**
- Created and ran a script to fix the database
- Updated all "MIXED" lineage values to "HYBRID" for classic strains
- Fixed both `canonical_lineage` and `sovereign_lineage` fields
- Result: 1 strain updated from "MIXED" to "HYBRID"

### 2. **Enhanced Lineage Persistence Logic** (`src/core/data/excel_processor.py`)
- **Function**: `optimized_lineage_persistence`
- **Fix**: Added explicit rejection of "MIXED" lineage for classic types
- **Logic**: Only apply database lineage if it's valid AND not "MIXED"
- **Added**: Immediate correction of any "MIXED" lineage in the current DataFrame

### 3. **Database Update Validation** (`src/core/data/excel_processor.py`)
- **Function**: `batch_lineage_database_update`
- **Fix**: Added validation to prevent saving "MIXED" lineage for classic types
- **Logic**: Convert "MIXED" to "HYBRID" before saving to database
- **Added**: Validation against `VALID_CLASSIC_LINEAGES` constant

### 4. **File Loading Fix** (`src/core/data/excel_processor.py`)
- **Function**: `load_file`
- **Fix**: Added immediate correction of "MIXED" lineage for classic types during file load
- **Logic**: Detect and fix "MIXED" lineage before any other processing
- **Added**: Logging to track how many products were fixed

### 5. **Constants Validation** (`src/core/constants.py`)
- **Constant**: `VALID_CLASSIC_LINEAGES`
- **Values**: SATIVA, INDICA, HYBRID, HYBRID/SATIVA, HYBRID/INDICA, CBD
- **Note**: "MIXED" is explicitly excluded from valid classic lineages

## Technical Details

### Database Fix
```sql
UPDATE strains SET canonical_lineage = 'HYBRID' WHERE canonical_lineage = 'MIXED'
UPDATE strains SET sovereign_lineage = 'HYBRID' WHERE sovereign_lineage = 'MIXED'
```

### Lineage Persistence Logic
```python
# Explicitly reject MIXED lineage for classic types
if db_lineage and db_lineage.upper() in valid_classic_lineages and db_lineage.upper() != 'MIXED':
    strain_lineage_map[strain_name] = db_lineage
```

### File Loading Fix
```python
# Fix any MIXED lineage for classic types
mixed_lineage_mask = (self.df["Lineage"] == "MIXED") & classic_mask
if mixed_lineage_mask.any():
    self.df.loc[mixed_lineage_mask, "Lineage"] = "HYBRID"
    self.logger.info(f"Fixed {mixed_lineage_mask.sum()} classic products with MIXED lineage")
```

### Database Update Validation
```python
# For classic types, ensure we never save MIXED lineage
if most_common_lineage.upper() == 'MIXED':
    lineage_to_save = 'HYBRID'
    processor.logger.warning(f"Preventing MIXED lineage save for classic strain '{strain_name}'")
```

## Testing Results

### Test Script Results
- ✅ **Classic Types**: All 5 classic types with "MIXED" lineage were correctly changed to "HYBRID"
- ✅ **Non-Classic Types**: All 2 non-classic types correctly retained "MIXED" lineage
- ✅ **Validation**: 0 classic types with "MIXED" lineage after fix
- ✅ **Preservation**: 2 non-classic types with "MIXED" lineage preserved

### Application Status
- ✅ **Startup**: Application loads successfully without errors
- ✅ **File Loading**: No more "Finalizing upload..." hang
- ✅ **Database**: Clean database with no "MIXED" lineage for classic types
- ✅ **Lineage Assignment**: Classic types now get proper lineage values

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Classic products were incorrectly showing "MIXED" lineage
- Application would hang on "Finalizing upload..."
- Database contained incorrect lineage data
- Users saw wrong lineage information in the UI

### After Fix
- Classic products show proper lineage (SATIVA, INDICA, HYBRID, etc.)
- Application loads files quickly without hanging
- Database contains correct lineage data
- Users see accurate lineage information in the UI

## Files Modified

1. **`src/core/data/excel_processor.py`**
   - `optimized_lineage_persistence()` function
   - `batch_lineage_database_update()` function
   - `load_file()` method

2. **`product_database.db`**
   - Updated strain lineage data
   - Removed "MIXED" lineage for classic types

3. **`src/core/constants.py`**
   - `VALID_CLASSIC_LINEAGES` constant (already existed, used for validation)

## Prevention

The fix includes multiple layers of protection:
1. **Database Level**: Clean database prevents future issues
2. **Application Level**: Validation prevents invalid lineage assignment
3. **File Loading Level**: Immediate correction of any "MIXED" lineage
4. **Database Update Level**: Prevention of saving invalid lineage

This comprehensive approach ensures that "MIXED" lineage will never be assigned to classic types again, either from the database or during file processing.
