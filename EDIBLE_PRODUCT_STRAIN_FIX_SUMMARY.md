# Edible Product Strain Fix Summary

## Issue
The edible Product Strain column was not calculating the correct values. The system was applying CBD Blend Product Strain assignment to ALL products that contained CBD, CBG, CBN, or CBC in their descriptions, rather than only applying this logic to edible products.

## Requirements
- **Edibles with cannabinoids**: Descriptions containing "CBD CBG CBN or CBC" should get "CBD Blend" Product Strain
- **Edibles without cannabinoids**: All other edibles should get "Mixed" Product Strain
- **Non-edibles**: Should not be affected by this edible-specific logic

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Edible-Specific Product Strain Logic
Added a new section in `src/core/data/excel_processor.py` that specifically handles edible Product Strain assignment:

```python
# Edibles: if Description contains CBD, CBG, CBN, or CBC, then Product Strain is "CBD Blend", otherwise "Mixed"
edible_types = {"edible (solid)", "edible (liquid)", "high cbd edible liquid", "tincture", "topical", "capsule"}
edible_mask = self.df["Product Type*"].str.strip().str.lower().isin(edible_types)
if edible_mask.any():
    # Check if Description contains CBD, CBG, CBN, or CBC
    edible_cbd_content_mask = (
        self.df["Description"].str.contains(r"CBD|CBG|CBN|CBC", case=False, na=False)
    )
    
    # For edibles with cannabinoid content in Description, set to "CBD Blend"
    edible_cbd_mask = edible_mask & edible_cbd_content_mask
    if edible_cbd_mask.any():
        self.df.loc[edible_cbd_mask, "Product Strain"] = "CBD Blend"
        self.logger.info(f"Assigned 'CBD Blend' to {edible_cbd_mask.sum()} edibles with cannabinoid content in Description")
    
    # For edibles without cannabinoid content in Description, set to "Mixed"
    edible_mixed_mask = edible_mask & ~edible_cbd_content_mask
    if edible_mixed_mask.any():
        self.df.loc[edible_mixed_mask, "Product Strain"] = "Mixed"
        self.logger.info(f"Assigned 'Mixed' to {edible_mixed_mask.sum()} edibles without cannabinoid content in Description")
```

### 2. Modified Existing Logic to Exclude Edibles
Updated the existing Product Strain assignment logic to exclude edibles, since they now have their own specific logic:

```python
# If Description contains ":" or "CBD", set Product Strain to 'CBD Blend' (excluding edibles which have their own logic)
edible_types = {"edible (solid)", "edible (liquid)", "high cbd edible liquid", "tincture", "topical", "capsule"}
non_edible_mask = ~self.df["Product Type*"].str.strip().str.lower().isin(edible_types)

mask_cbd_blend = (self.df["Description"].str.contains(":", na=False) | self.df["Description"].str.contains("CBD", case=False, na=False)) & non_edible_mask
```

## Edible Types Covered
The fix applies to the following edible product types:
- `edible (solid)`
- `edible (liquid)`
- `high cbd edible liquid`
- `tincture`
- `topical`
- `capsule`

## Logic Rules
1. **Edibles with cannabinoids**: If the Description contains "CBD", "CBG", "CBN", or "CBC" (case-insensitive), Product Strain = "CBD Blend"
2. **Edibles without cannabinoids**: If the Description does not contain these cannabinoids, Product Strain = "Mixed"
3. **Non-edibles**: Not affected by this logic, maintain their original Product Strain values

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test_edible_product_strain_fix.py`: Tests basic edible logic
- `test_comprehensive_edible_strain_fix.py`: Tests both edible and non-edible products

### Test Results
- ✅ All edible products with cannabinoids correctly assigned "CBD Blend"
- ✅ All edible products without cannabinoids correctly assigned "Mixed"
- ✅ All non-edible products unaffected by edible logic
- ✅ 100% test success rate

## Files Modified
- `src/core/data/excel_processor.py`: Added edible-specific Product Strain logic and modified existing logic to exclude edibles

## Files Created
- `test_edible_product_strain_fix.py`: Basic test script
- `test_comprehensive_edible_strain_fix.py`: Comprehensive test script
- `EDIBLE_PRODUCT_STRAIN_FIX_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. Edible products are correctly categorized based on their cannabinoid content
2. Non-edible products are not incorrectly affected by edible-specific logic
3. The Product Strain column accurately reflects the product composition for edibles
4. The system maintains backward compatibility for non-edible products
