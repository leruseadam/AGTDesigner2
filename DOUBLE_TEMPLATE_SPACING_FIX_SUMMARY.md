# Double Template Spacing Fix Summary

## Issue
Brand and product strain were being attached together without proper spacing in the double template, even though they should have separate font sizing.

## Problem Description
The double template was rendering content like:
```
'•  HYBRIDTest Brand 1Test Strain 1'
```

Instead of the expected format with proper line breaks:
```
'•  HYBRID
Test Brand 1
Test Strain 1'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `_process_paragraph_for_markers_template_specific` method in `src/core/generation/template_processor.py`. The method was removing line breaks and whitespace between markers during the multi-marker processing.

Specifically, these conditions were too restrictive:
```python
if text_before.strip():  # This removed line breaks
if text_after.strip():   # This removed line breaks
```

## Solution
Modified the multi-marker processing logic to preserve line breaks and whitespace between markers while still skipping completely empty content.

### Changes Made

**File**: `src/core/generation/template_processor.py`
**Method**: `_process_paragraph_for_markers_template_specific`
**Lines**: 1030-1035 and 1050-1055

**Before**:
```python
if text_before.strip():
    run = paragraph.add_run(text_before)
    # ... font settings

if text_after.strip():
    run = paragraph.add_run(text_after)
    # ... font settings
```

**After**:
```python
# Preserve line breaks and whitespace, but skip if completely empty
if text_before or text_before.strip():
    run = paragraph.add_run(text_before)
    # ... font settings

# Preserve line breaks and whitespace, but skip if completely empty
if text_after or text_after.strip():
    run = paragraph.add_run(text_after)
    # ... font settings
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script `test_double_template_spacing_fix.py` that verifies:
1. Line breaks are preserved between different fields
2. Brand and product strain are properly separated
3. Each field maintains its own font sizing
4. Content is rendered in the expected format

## Results
✅ **Lineage is properly separated**: `•  HYBRID` appears on its own line  
✅ **Brand is properly separated**: `Test Brand 1` appears on its own line  
✅ **Product strain is properly separated**: `Test Strain 1` appears on its own line  
✅ **Font sizing is preserved**: Each field maintains its own font size  
✅ **Line breaks are preserved**: Proper spacing between all fields  

## Final Output Format
The double template now correctly renders content as:
```
•  HYBRID
Test Brand 1
Test Strain 1
```

Instead of the previous incorrect format:
```
•  HYBRIDTest Brand 1Test Strain 1
```

## Impact
- Double template now properly separates brand and product strain with line breaks
- Each field maintains its own font sizing as intended
- Improved readability and visual separation of different content types
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing templates
- No changes required to template files or data processing
