# PythonAnywhere Upload Status Race Condition Fix

## Problem Summary
PythonAnywhere was experiencing an issue where file uploads would show "not_found" status after successful processing, even though the files were actually loaded correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a **race condition** in the upload status cleanup system:

1. **File Processing**: Files were being processed successfully and marked as 'ready'
2. **Frontend Polling**: The frontend was polling for upload status every few seconds
3. **Aggressive Cleanup**: The cleanup function was clearing 'ready' statuses too quickly (after 30 minutes)
4. **Race Condition**: The cleanup was running while the frontend was still polling, causing status to become 'not_found'

## Technical Details

### The Problem Code
```python
# In cleanup_old_processing_status()
if status == 'ready' and age < 1800:  # 30 minutes for ready status
    continue
```

### The Fix Applied
```python
# Increased timeout to prevent race conditions
if status == 'ready' and age < 3600:  # 60 minutes for ready status
    continue
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended Cleanup Timeout
- **Before**: 'ready' statuses were cleared after 30 minutes
- **After**: 'ready' statuses are now kept for 60 minutes
- **Reason**: Gives frontend more time to complete polling without race conditions

### 2. Reduced Cleanup Frequency
- **Before**: Cleanup ran 10% of the time on status requests
- **After**: Cleanup now runs only 5% of the time
- **Reason**: Reduces the chance of cleanup interfering with active uploads

## Verification Steps

### On PythonAnywhere:
1. **Pull Latest Changes**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/adamcordova/AGTDesigner
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Reload Web App**:
   - Go to PythonAnywhere Web tab
   - Click "Reload" button

3. **Test File Upload**:
   - Upload a new file
   - Verify status transitions: `processing` → `ready` → (stays ready)
   - Confirm no more "not_found" status after successful processing

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **Correct Flow**:
1. File upload starts → Status: `processing`
2. Background processing completes → Status: `ready`
3. Frontend polls status → Status: `ready` (stays ready)
4. Frontend loads data successfully
5. Status remains `ready` for 60 minutes before cleanup

### ❌ **Previous Problem Flow**:
1. File upload starts → Status: `processing`
2. Background processing completes → Status: `ready`
3. Frontend polls status → Status: `ready`
4. Cleanup runs too early → Status: `not_found`
5. Frontend shows error despite successful processing

## Files Modified
- `app.py`: Updated `cleanup_old_processing_status()` function
- Increased timeout from 30 minutes to 60 minutes for 'ready' statuses

## Deployment Status
- ✅ **Committed**: Changes committed to local repository
- ✅ **Pushed**: Changes pushed to GitHub repository
- 🔄 **Pending**: PythonAnywhere needs to pull and reload

## Next Steps
1. **On PythonAnywhere**: Pull the latest changes and reload the web app
2. **Test**: Upload a new file to verify the fix works
3. **Monitor**: Watch for any remaining issues with upload status

## Impact
This fix resolves the issue where users would see upload failures even when files were processed successfully. The application will now provide more reliable feedback during the upload process.
