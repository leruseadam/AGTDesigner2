# Tiered Categories Display Fix

## Problem Description

The tiered categories (vendor, brand, product type, weight levels) were not displaying properly in the "CURRENT INVENTORY" section. The application was showing a flat list of products instead of the hierarchical structure that should group products by vendor, brand, product type, and weight.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that the `_updateAvailableTags` function in `static/js/main.js` was using a flat list display instead of the tiered hierarchical structure that was already implemented in the `updateSelectedTags` function. Additionally, some CSS variables were missing for the tiered structure styling.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. JavaScript Fix - Tiered Structure Implementation

Modified the `_updateAvailableTags` function in `static/js/main.js` to use the same tiered structure as the selected tags:

- **Before**: The function created individual tag elements in a flat list
- **After**: The function now uses `organizeBrandCategories()` to create a hierarchical structure with:
  - Vendor sections with checkboxes
  - Brand sections under each vendor with checkboxes
  - Product type sections under each brand with checkboxes
  - Weight sections under each product type with checkboxes
  - Individual products as leaf nodes under weight sections

### 2. CSS Variables Fix

Added missing CSS variables in `static/css/styles.css`:

```css
/* Tiered structure colors */
--primary-color: #a084e8;
--secondary-color: #8b5cf6;
--accent-color: #43e97b;
--text-muted: rgba(238, 238, 238, 0.6);
```

These variables are used by the tiered structure CSS classes:
- `.vendor-section` uses `--primary-color`
- `.brand-section` uses `--secondary-color`
- `.product-type-header` uses `--accent-color`
- `.weight-header` uses `--text-muted`

### 3. Hierarchical Structure

The tiered categories now display as:

```
Vendor (1555 INDUSTRIAL LLC) [☐]
├── Brand (HUSTLER'S AMBITION) [☐]
│   ├── Product Type (Concentrate) [☐]
│   │   ├── Weight (1G) [☐]
│   │   │   ├── Product 1 [☐]
│   │   │   ├── Product 2 [☐]
│   │   │   └── Product 3 [☐]
│   │   └── Weight (3.5G) [☐]
│   │       └── Product 4 [☐]
│   └── Product Type (Flower) [☐]
│       └── Weight (28G) [☐]
│           └── Product 5 [☐]
└── Brand (MAMA J'S) [☐]
    └── Product Type (Edible) [☐]
        └── Weight (100mg) [☐]
            └── Product 6 [☐]
```

## Features

1. **Hierarchical Checkboxes**: Each level (vendor, brand, product type, weight) has its own checkbox that can select/deselect all items below it
2. **Indeterminate State**: Checkboxes show indeterminate state when some but not all child items are selected
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Different colors and indentation levels make the structure clear
4. **Consistent Styling**: Same styling as the selected tags section for consistency
5. **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient DOM manipulation and event handling

## Files Modified

1. **static/js/main.js**: Updated `_updateAvailableTags` function to use tiered structure
2. **static/css/styles.css**: Added missing CSS variables for tiered structure colors

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified that:
- Tiered categories now display properly in the "CURRENT INVENTORY" section
- Checkboxes work correctly at all hierarchy levels
- Visual styling is consistent with the selected tags section
- Performance is maintained with large datasets

## Result

The tiered categories are now properly displayed in both the "CURRENT INVENTORY" and "SELECTED TAGS" sections, providing users with a clear hierarchical view of their products organized by vendor, brand, product type, and weight.
