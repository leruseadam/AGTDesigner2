# ShowNotification Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The strain lineage editor was failing with the error "showNotification is not defined" when trying to save strain lineage changes.

## Root Cause
The lineage editor was trying to call `showNotification` as a global function, but this function was not defined globally. The `showNotification` function existed only as a method within the `database-sync.js` class, not as a global function accessible to the lineage editor.

## Problem Code
```javascript
// In lineage-editor.js - Line 457 and 1029
showNotification('Lineage updated successfully!', 'success');
showNotification(`Strain lineage updated successfully! Affected ${affectedCount} products.`, 'success');
```

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Function Calls
**File**: `static/js/lineage-editor.js`
- Changed global `showNotification` calls to instance method calls using `this.showNotification`
- Updated both occurrences in the `LineageEditor` and `StrainLineageEditor` classes

### 2. Added showNotification Methods
**File**: `static/js/lineage-editor.js`
- Added `showNotification` method to the `LineageEditor` class
- Added `showNotification` method to the `StrainLineageEditor` class
- Both methods create Bootstrap alert notifications that auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

### 3. Notification Implementation
The notification system creates:
- Bootstrap alert elements with proper styling
- Positioned in the top-right corner with high z-index
- Auto-dismiss functionality after 5 seconds
- Manual dismiss button
- Support for different alert types (success, info, warning, danger)

## Code Changes

### Before:
```javascript
// Global function call (undefined)
showNotification('Lineage updated successfully!', 'success');
```

### After:
```javascript
// Instance method call
this.showNotification('Lineage updated successfully!', 'success');

// With implementation
showNotification(message, type = 'info') {
    const notification = document.createElement('div');
    notification.className = `alert alert-${type} alert-dismissible fade show position-fixed`;
    notification.style.cssText = 'top: 20px; right: 20px; z-index: 9999; min-width: 300px;';
    notification.innerHTML = `
        ${message}
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert"></button>
    `;
    
    document.body.appendChild(notification);
    
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (notification.parentNode) {
            notification.remove();
        }
    }, 5000);
}
```

## What This Fixes
1. **Eliminates the "showNotification is not defined" error**
2. **Provides proper user feedback** when strain lineage updates are successful
3. **Maintains consistent notification styling** with the rest of the application
4. **Ensures notifications are visible** with proper positioning and z-index
5. **Prevents notification clutter** with auto-dismiss functionality

## Testing
- Strain lineage editor should now show success notifications when updates are completed
- Notifications should appear in the top-right corner
- Notifications should auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Manual dismiss button should work properly
- No more "showNotification is not defined" errors in the console
