# Auto Scroll to Top Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Users wanted the application to automatically scroll back to the top of the list after selecting a new filter or performing a search. This improves the user experience by ensuring users can see the filtered results from the beginning.

## Root Cause
When filters were applied or search was performed, the list would update with new content but the scroll position would remain wherever the user had scrolled to, making it difficult to see the filtered results.

## Problem
- **Filter Application**: After applying filters, users had to manually scroll to the top to see results
- **Search Results**: After searching, users had to manually scroll to the top to see matching items
- **Poor UX**: Users couldn't immediately see the filtered/search results without manual scrolling

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Scroll-to-Top for Filter Application
**File**: `static/js/main.js`
- Modified `_updateAvailableTags` method to automatically scroll to top when filters are applied
- Added condition to only scroll when `filteredTags !== null` (i.e., when filters are actually applied, not on initial load)
- Added 50ms delay to ensure DOM is updated before scrolling

### 2. Added Scroll-to-Top for Search Results
**File**: `static/js/main.js`
- Modified `handleSearch` method to automatically scroll to top after search
- Added scroll-to-top for both available tags and selected tags lists
- Added 50ms delay to ensure DOM is updated before scrolling

## Code Changes

### Filter Application Scroll-to-Top
```javascript
// In _updateAvailableTags method
// Scroll to top of available tags list after filter application
if (filteredTags !== null) {  // Only scroll when filters are applied (not initial load)
    setTimeout(() => {
        const availableTagsContainer = document.getElementById('availableTags');
        if (availableTagsContainer) {
            availableTagsContainer.scrollTop = 0;
        }
    }, 50);  // Small delay to ensure DOM is updated
}
```

### Search Results Scroll-to-Top
```javascript
// In handleSearch method
// Update the list with only matching tags
if (listId === 'availableTags') {
    this.debouncedUpdateAvailableTags(this.state.originalTags, filteredTags);
    // Scroll to top of available tags list after search
    setTimeout(() => {
        const availableTagsContainer = document.getElementById('availableTags');
        if (availableTagsContainer) {
            availableTagsContainer.scrollTop = 0;
        }
    }, 50);
} else if (listId === 'selectedTags') {
    this.updateSelectedTags(filteredTags);
    // Scroll to top of selected tags list after search
    setTimeout(() => {
        const selectedTagsContainer = document.getElementById('selectedTags');
        if (selectedTagsContainer) {
            selectedTagsContainer.scrollTop = 0;
        }
    }, 50);
}
```

## What This Fixes
1. **Automatic Scroll on Filter**: When users select a filter, the list automatically scrolls to the top
2. **Automatic Scroll on Search**: When users search, the results automatically scroll to the top
3. **Better User Experience**: Users can immediately see filtered/search results without manual scrolling
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Both available tags and selected tags lists scroll to top appropriately
5. **Smart Timing**: Only scrolls when filters are actually applied, not on initial page load

## Implementation Details
- **Conditional Scrolling**: Only scrolls when filters are applied (`filteredTags !== null`), not on initial page load
- **Small Delay**: 50ms delay ensures DOM is fully updated before scrolling
- **Container Targeting**: Targets the specific container (`availableTags` or `selectedTags`) that was updated
- **Error Handling**: Checks if container exists before attempting to scroll

## Testing
- Apply any filter (vendor, brand, product type, lineage, weight, DOH, High CBD) → list should scroll to top
- Search for products in available tags → list should scroll to top
- Search for products in selected tags → list should scroll to top
- Initial page load → should NOT scroll to top (only when filters are applied)
- Clear filters → should scroll to top to show all results
