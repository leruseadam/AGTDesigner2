# Product Strain Fix - Summary

## Issue Description

The user reported that Product Strain was showing Brand name instead of the correct values (CBD Blend or Mixed) for edible products.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the template processor where Product Strain was being incorrectly set to the brand name for edible products instead of using the actual Product Strain value from the data.

**Problem Location**: `src/core/generation/template_processor.py` lines 607-612

**Problem Code**:
```python
# For edibles, use brand instead of strain
if product_type in edible_types:
    product_brand = record.get('ProductBrand', '') or record.get('Product Brand', '')
    if product_brand:
        label_context['ProductStrain'] = product_brand.upper()
    else:
        label_context['ProductStrain'] = record.get('ProductStrain', '') or record.get('Product Strain', '')
else:
    # For non-edibles, use the actual strain
    label_context['ProductStrain'] = record.get('ProductStrain', '') or record.get('Product Strain', '')
```

## Solution Implemented

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# For all product types, use the actual Product Strain value
label_context['ProductStrain'] = record.get('ProductStrain', '') or record.get('Product Strain', '')
```

**Explanation**: Removed the incorrect logic that was setting Product Strain to the brand name for edibles. Now all product types use the actual Product Strain value from the data.

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ CBD Gummies: Product Strain showed "TEST BRAND" (incorrect)
- ❌ CBD Tincture: Product Strain showed "TEST BRAND" (incorrect)

### After Fix
- ✅ CBD Gummies: Product Strain shows "CBD Blend" (correct)
- ✅ CBD Tincture: Product Strain shows "CBD Blend" (correct)
- ✅ Classic types: Product Strain shows empty (correct)

### Debug Output Confirmation
```
'ProductStrain': 'PRODUCTSTRAIN_STARTCBD BlendPRODUCTSTRAIN_END'
text='CBD Blend'
```

## Files Modified

- `src/core/generation/template_processor.py` (lines ~607-612)

## Impact

✅ **Fixed**: Edible products now correctly display their Product Strain values:
- Products with cannabinoid content in description: "CBD Blend"
- Products without cannabinoid content: "Mixed"
- Classic types: Empty (as expected)

✅ **Consistent**: All product types now use the same logic for Product Strain display

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Product Strain fix is working correctly. Edible products now show the proper Product Strain values instead of the brand name.
