# Enhanced Strain Information for JSON Matching

## Overview
This implementation ensures that brand info, weights, and other crucial information is properly attached to strains in the database for JSON matching functionality. The system now provides comprehensive strain information including associated products, brands, vendors, weights, and prices.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Product Database Methods

#### `get_strain_with_products_info(strain_name)`

- **Returns**: Complete strain data with aggregated brand, vendor, weight, and price information
- **Features**:
  - All products associated with the strain
  - Brand-specific lineage overrides
  - Most common values (brand, vendor, weight, price)
  - Total product count and occurrence statistics

#### `get_strain_brand_info(strain_name, brand)`
- **Purpose**: Get strain information with specific brand context
- **Returns**: Brand-specific strain data with associated product information
- **Features**:
  - Brand-specific lineage overrides
  - Products filtered by brand
  - Aggregated weight, price, and vendor data for the brand

#### `get_strains_with_brand_info(limit)`
- **Purpose**: Get a list of strains with their associated brand, weight, vendor, and price information
- **Returns**: List of strains with their most common associated information
- **Features**:
  - Most frequently occurring brand, vendor, weight, and price for each strain
  - Sorted by total occurrences
  - Configurable limit for performance

### 2. Enhanced JSON Matcher

#### `_get_strain_comprehensive_info(strain_name, vendor, brand)`
- **Purpose**: Get comprehensive strain information for JSON matching
- **Features**:
  - Brand-specific information lookup
  - Fallback to general strain information
  - Final fallback to basic strain info
  - Error handling and logging

#### `_create_enhanced_fallback_tag(json_item, strain_name, vendor, brand)`
- **Purpose**: Create enhanced fallback tags with comprehensive strain information
- **Features**:
  - Uses real strain data for lineage, price, weight, and vendor information
  - Brand-specific lineage overrides
  - Intelligent price estimation based on product type
  - Complete product information including weight units

### 3. New API Endpoints

#### `/api/strain-info/<strain_name>` (GET)
- **Purpose**: Get comprehensive strain information
- **Response**: Complete strain data with all associated products and aggregated information

#### `/api/strain-brand-info/<strain_name>` (GET)
- **Purpose**: Get strain information with specific brand context
- **Parameters**: `brand` (query parameter)
- **Response**: Brand-specific strain information

#### `/api/strains-with-brand-info` (GET)
- **Purpose**: Get list of strains with brand information
- **Parameters**: `limit` (query parameter, default: 100)
- **Response**: List of strains with associated brand, vendor, weight, and price data

#### `/api/enhanced-strain-match` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced strain matching for JSON processing
- **Body**: `{"product_name": "...", "vendor": "...", "brand": "..."}`
- **Response**: Found strains with comprehensive information

## Database Schema Enhancements

The existing database schema already supports the enhanced functionality:

### Tables Used
- **strains**: Basic strain information with canonical and sovereign lineages
- **products**: Product information linked to strains with brand, vendor, weight, price data
- **strain_brand_lineage**: Brand-specific lineage overrides

### Key Relationships
- Products are linked to strains via `strain_id` foreign key
- Brand-specific lineages are stored in `strain_brand_lineage` table
- All products have vendor, brand, weight, units, and price information

## Test Results

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with the following results:

### Database Statistics
- **Total strains**: 1,020
- **Total products**: 2,647
- **Products with strain associations**: 2,647 (100%)
- **Brand-specific lineages**: 3

### Sample Data Verification
1. **Papaya Guava** | Dank Czar | JSM LLC | 1g | $50
2. **Blue Voodoo** | Super Fog | MFUSED | 1g | $45
3. **CBD Blend** | Wyld | NCMX, LLC | 1.4oz | $35
4. **Paraphernalia** | Paraphernalia | Cobalt Packaging and Design | 0g | $22
5. **Paraphernalia** | Paraphernalia | Costco Wholesale | 0g | $2.5

### Strain Information Examples
- **Blue Dream**: 25 products, most common brand: Artizen, weight: 1g, price: $50
- **Super Boof**: 20 products, most common brand: Rocket Cannabis, weight: 1g, price: $35
- **Grand Daddy Purple**: 21 products, most common brand: Phat Panda, weight: 1g, price: $30

## Benefits for JSON Matching

### 1. Improved Accuracy
- **Real data**: Uses actual product data instead of hardcoded values
- **Brand context**: Considers brand-specific lineage and pricing
- **Vendor context**: Uses vendor-specific information when available

### 2. Enhanced Fallback Tags
- **Complete information**: Includes weight, units, price, vendor, and brand
- **Strain association**: Links products to specific strains when found
- **Intelligent defaults**: Uses most common values from the database

### 3. Better Lineage Assignment
- **Brand-specific overrides**: Uses brand-specific lineages when available
- **Sovereign lineages**: Respects manually set sovereign lineages
- **Mode-based fallbacks**: Uses statistical mode of lineages when available

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Comprehensive caching for strain and product information
- **Batch processing**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking database integration

## Usage Examples

### 1. Get Comprehensive Strain Information
```python
product_db = ProductDatabase()
strain_info = product_db.get_strain_with_products_info("Blue Dream")
print(f"Lineage: {strain_info['strain_info']['display_lineage']}")
print(f"Most common brand: {strain_info['aggregated_info']['most_common_brand']}")
print(f"Most common weight: {strain_info['aggregated_info']['most_common_weight']}")
```

### 2. Enhanced JSON Matching
```python
json_matcher = JSONMatcher(excel_processor)
fallback_tag = json_matcher._create_enhanced_fallback_tag(
    json_item, "Blue Dream", "JSM LLC", "Dank Czar"
)
print(f"Lineage: {fallback_tag['Lineage']}")
print(f"Price: {fallback_tag['Price']}")
print(f"Weight: {fallback_tag['Weight*']}")
```

### 3. API Usage
```bash
# Get comprehensive strain info
curl "http://localhost:9090/api/strain-info/Blue%20Dream"

# Get brand-specific info
curl "http://localhost:9090/api/strain-brand-info/Blue%20Dream?brand=Dank%20Czar"

# Enhanced strain matching
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9090/api/enhanced-strain-match" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_name": "Blue Dream Flower", "vendor": "JSM LLC", "brand": "Dank Czar"}'
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced strain information system provides comprehensive data for JSON matching, ensuring that brand info, weights, and other crucial information is properly attached to strains. This results in more accurate matching, better fallback tag creation, and improved overall functionality for the JSON matching feature.

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding significant new capabilities for accessing and utilizing strain-related product information.
