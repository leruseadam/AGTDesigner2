# Product Similarity Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified

While vendor-based filtering was working correctly (matching products within the same vendor family), the actual product matching within vendors was poor. For example:
- "Medically Compliant - Dank Czar Rosin All-In-One - GMO - 1g" → "$30 Dank Czar Dab Mat - Small" (score: 0.10)
- "Medically Compliant - Dank Czar Sugar Wax - Grape Animal - 1g" → "$30 Dank Czar Dab Mat - Small" (score: 0.10)

The issue was that while we were correctly finding vendor matches, the products being matched were not very similar (Rosin vs Dab Mat).

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Poor Product Type Recognition**: The system wasn't properly identifying and matching product types (rosin, wax, cartridge, etc.)
2. **Missing Strain Name Matching**: Strain names weren't being used effectively for matching similar products
3. **Generic Key Term Matching**: The key term extraction was too generic and didn't prioritize cannabis-specific terms
4. **Low Scoring Thresholds**: The scoring system wasn't giving enough weight to product type and strain matches

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Key Term Extraction
Improved the `_extract_key_terms` function to:
- **Product Type Recognition**: Identify cannabis product types (rosin, wax, shatter, live resin, distillate, cartridge, pre-roll, blunt, edible, tincture, topical, concentrate, flower, infused)
- **Strain Name Recognition**: Identify common cannabis strain names (GMO, Runtz, Cookies, Wedding Cake, Blueberry, Banana, etc.)
- **Better Filtering**: Exclude more generic terms (mg, thc, cbd) while keeping meaningful cannabis terms

### 2. Improved Scoring System
Enhanced the scoring function to:
- **Product Type Bonus**: 20% bonus for matching product types
- **Strain Name Bonus**: 30% bonus for matching strain names
- **Lowered Thresholds**: Reduced minimum score requirements for better matching
- **Combined Scoring**: Better combination of vendor, product type, and strain matching

### 3. Better Vendor Match Selection
Added `_find_better_vendor_matches` function to:
- **Score Vendor Candidates**: Evaluate each vendor candidate based on product similarity
- **Product Type Priority**: Prioritize candidates with matching product types
- **Strain Name Priority**: Prioritize candidates with matching strain names
- **Filter Low-Quality Matches**: Only return candidates with meaningful similarity scores

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Key Term Extraction
```python
def _extract_key_terms(self, name: str) -> Set[str]:
    # Product type indicators for better matching
    product_types = {
        'rosin', 'wax', 'shatter', 'live', 'resin', 'distillate', 'cartridge', 'pre-roll', 'pre-rolls',
        'blunt', 'blunts', 'edible', 'edibles', 'tincture', 'tinctures', 'topical', 'topicals',
        'concentrate', 'concentrates', 'flower', 'buds', 'infused', 'flavour', 'flavor'
    }
    
    # Strain names (common cannabis strain words)
    strain_indicators = {
        'gmo', 'runtz', 'cookies', 'cream', 'wedding', 'cake', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'strawberry',
        'grape', 'lemon', 'lime', 'orange', 'cherry', 'apple', 'mango', 'pineapple', 'passion',
        'dragon', 'fruit', 'guava', 'pink', 'lemonade', 'haze', 'kush', 'diesel', 'og', 'sherbet',
        'gelato', 'mintz', 'grinch', 'cosmic', 'combo', 'honey', 'bread', 'tricho', 'jordan',
        'super', 'boof', 'grandy', 'candy', 'afghani', 'hashplant', 'yoda', 'amnesia'
    }
```

### Improved Scoring System
```python
# Bonus for product type matches
product_type_bonus = 0.0
if json_product_types and cache_product_types and json_product_types == cache_product_types:
    product_type_bonus = 0.2  # 20% bonus for matching product types

# Bonus for strain name matches
strain_bonus = 0.0
if json_strains and cache_strains and json_strains == cache_strains:
    strain_bonus = 0.3  # 30% bonus for matching strain names

final_score = min(0.9, term_score) + vendor_bonus - vendor_penalty + product_type_bonus + strain_bonus
```

### Better Vendor Match Selection
```python
def _find_better_vendor_matches(self, json_item: dict, vendor_candidates: List[dict]) -> List[dict]:
    # Score each vendor candidate based on:
    # - Product type similarity (40% for exact match, 20% for partial)
    # - Strain name similarity (50% for exact match, 30% for partial)
    # - General term overlap (30% weight)
    # - Contains matching (20% bonus)
    
    # Return only candidates with meaningful scores (> 0.1)
```

## Expected Results

### Before Improvements:
- **Poor Product Matching**: Rosin products matched to Dab Mats
- **Low Scores**: 0.10 scores indicating poor matches
- **Generic Matching**: Based on general terms rather than product-specific terms

### After Improvements:
- **Better Product Matching**: Rosin products should match to similar rosin products
- **Higher Scores**: Better scores for meaningful matches
- **Product-Specific Matching**: Based on product types and strain names
- **Vendor Consistency**: Still maintains vendor-based filtering

## Benefits

1. **✅ Better Product Matching**: Products matched to similar products within the same vendor
2. **✅ Higher Quality Matches**: Better scores indicating more meaningful matches
3. **✅ Product Type Awareness**: System understands cannabis product categories
4. **✅ Strain Name Recognition**: System recognizes and matches strain names
5. **✅ Maintained Vendor Filtering**: Still prevents cross-vendor matches
6. **✅ Improved User Experience**: More logical and predictable matching results

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expand Product Types**: Add more cannabis product categories
2. **Machine Learning**: Use ML to learn product similarity patterns
3. **User Feedback**: Allow users to correct product matches
4. **Strain Database**: Integrate with a cannabis strain database for better matching
5. **Product Hierarchy**: Implement product category hierarchies for better matching

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Product Type Matching**: Verify rosin products match to rosin products
2. **Test Strain Matching**: Verify GMO products match to GMO products
3. **Test Vendor Consistency**: Ensure no cross-vendor matches
4. **Test Score Improvements**: Verify higher scores for better matches
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Test with unusual product names and types
