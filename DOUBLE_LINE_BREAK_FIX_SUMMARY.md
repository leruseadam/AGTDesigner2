# Double Line Break Fix - Summary

## Issue Description

The user reported that there were "2 breaks" instead of 1 in the ratio formatting. The ratio content was displaying with double line breaks instead of single line breaks.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: The line break formatting was being applied **twice** in the processing pipeline:

1. **First application**: In `src/core/data/excel_processor.py` line 1882
   ```python
   if product_type in {"edible (solid)", "edible (liquid)", "high cbd edible liquid", "tincture", "topical", "capsule"}:
       ratio_text = format_ratio_multiline(ratio_text)
   ```

2. **Second application**: In `src/core/generation/template_processor.py` lines 490-500
   ```python
   if product_type in edible_types:
       # Apply line break formatting to all edible ratio content
       def break_after_2nd_space(s):
           # ... line break logic
       cleaned_ratio = break_after_2nd_space(cleaned_ratio)
   ```

This caused the same line break formatting to be applied twice, resulting in double line breaks in the final output.

## Solution Implemented

### Removed Duplicate Processing

**File**: `src/core/data/excel_processor.py` lines 1880-1885

**Before**:
```python
# Format the ratio text - only apply edible formatting to edibles
if product_type in {"edible (solid)", "edible (liquid)", "high cbd edible liquid", "tincture", "topical", "capsule"}:
    ratio_text = format_ratio_multiline(ratio_text)
# For classic types (including RSO/CO2 Tankers), don't apply edible formatting
# The template processor will handle the classic formatting
```

**After**:
```python
# Don't apply ratio formatting here - let the template processor handle it
# For classic types (including RSO/CO2 Tankers), the template processor will handle the classic formatting
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Duplicate Processing**: Eliminated the `format_ratio_multiline()` call from the excel processor
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Now only the template processor applies line break formatting
3. **Preserved Logic**: The template processor still correctly applies line breaks after every 2nd space
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All other processing logic remains intact

## Test Results

Created and ran `test_template_ratio_formatting.py` which verifies:

✅ **Single Line Breaks Now Applied**:
- Input: `'10mg THC 30mg CBD 5mg CBG 5mg CBN'`
- Output: `'10mg THC\n30mg CBD\n5mg CBG\n5mg CBN'` (single line breaks)
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Correct Formatting for Different Content**:
- Input: `'THC 10mg CBD 20mg'`
- Output: `'THC 10mg\nCBD 20mg'` (single line breaks)
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Classic Types Unaffected**:
- Input: `'THC 10mg CBD 20mg'` (flower type)
- Output: `'THC 10mg CBD 20mg'` (no line breaks)
- Result: ✅ PASS

## Logic Flow

**Before Fix**:
1. Excel Processor: Apply line breaks → `'10mg THC\n30mg CBD\n5mg CBG\n5mg CBN'`
2. Template Processor: Apply line breaks again → `'10mg THC\n\n30mg CBD\n\n5mg CBG\n\n5mg CBN'` (double breaks)

**After Fix**:
1. Excel Processor: No formatting → `'10mg THC 30mg CBD 5mg CBG 5mg CBN'`
2. Template Processor: Apply line breaks → `'10mg THC\n30mg CBD\n5mg CBG\n5mg CBN'` (single breaks)

## Files Modified

- `src/core/data/excel_processor.py` - Removed duplicate `format_ratio_multiline()` call

## Impact

- **Fixed Double Line Breaks**: Ratio content now displays with single line breaks as intended
- **Improved Readability**: Cannabinoid content is properly formatted without excessive spacing
- **Maintained Functionality**: All other formatting and processing logic remains intact
- **Better User Experience**: Labels now display correctly without double line breaks

## Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Testing the template processor logic directly
2. Confirming single line breaks are applied correctly
3. Ensuring classic types are not affected
4. Verifying that the formatting is applied only once

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Double line break issue resolved. Ratio content now displays with single line breaks after every 2nd space as intended.
