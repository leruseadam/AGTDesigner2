# Ratio Line Break Fix Summary

## Problem
When adding line breaks to Ratio content (from a previous question), the system was adding extra line breaks to the end even when text ran out. This was causing unwanted empty lines in the generated documents.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `_convert_br_markers_to_line_breaks()` method in `src/core/generation/template_processor.py`. The original logic was:

```python
# Add a line break after each part (except the last one)
if i < len(parts) - 1:
    # Use add_break() with WD_BREAK.LINE to create proper line breaks within the same paragraph
    run.add_break(WD_BREAK.LINE)
```

This logic would add a line break after each part, even when the next part was empty. For example, with text like "THC:|BR|CBD:", it would create:
- Part 1: "THC:"
- Part 2: "CBD:" 
- Part 3: "" (empty)

The original code would add a line break after "THC:" (because there's a next part) and after "CBD:" (because there's a next part), resulting in an extra empty line at the end.

## Solution
Modified the logic to only add line breaks when the next part is not empty:

```python
# Add a line break after this part only if the next part is not empty
if i < len(parts) - 1 and parts[i + 1].strip():
    # Use add_break() with WD_BREAK.LINE to create proper line breaks within the same paragraph
    run.add_break(WD_BREAK.LINE)
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts to verify the fix:

1. **Unit tests** (`test_ratio_line_break_fix.py`):
   - Test 1: "THC:|BR|CBD:" → 2 lines (no extra break at end)
   - Test 2: "THC: 25%|BR|CBD: 15%" → 2 lines (line break in middle)
   - Test 3: "THC: 25%|BR|CBD: 15%|BR|CBG: 5%" → 3 lines (multiple line breaks)
   - Test 4: "THC: 25%|BR|" → 1 line (no extra break with empty end)

2. **Integration tests** (`test_real_ratio_line_break.py`):
   - Tested with real data from the application
   - Verified that empty ratio text doesn't create trailing empty lines
   - Confirmed that actual content is processed correctly

## Results
✅ **All tests pass**: The fix successfully prevents extra line breaks when text runs out
✅ **No regression**: Line breaks still work correctly for actual content
✅ **Real-world validation**: Tested with actual application data

## Files Modified
- `src/core/generation/template_processor.py`: Updated `_convert_br_markers_to_line_breaks()` method

## Impact
- **Before**: Ratio content like "THC:|BR|CBD:" would create an extra empty line at the end
- **After**: Ratio content creates exactly the right number of lines without trailing empty lines
- **User experience**: Cleaner, more professional-looking generated documents
