# Filename Generation Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The download filename was showing as "AGT_Unknown_Unknown_VERT_Labels_2TAGS_LIN_20250718_115147.docx" instead of including the proper vendor and product type information.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the filename generation logic where:

1. **Vendor field extraction**: The code was looking for vendor information but not finding it properly
2. **Product type field extraction**: Similar issue with product type field names
3. **Missing fallback logic**: No fallback to use ProductBrand when Vendor field is empty
4. **Debug logging**: Insufficient logging to identify the exact issue

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging for vendor and product type extraction
- Added logging for record keys and field values
- Added logging for vendor counts and product type counts
- Added logging for final vendor and product type selection

### 2. Improved Field Name Matching
- Added multiple possible vendor field names: `['Vendor', 'vendor', 'Vendor/Supplier*']`
- Added multiple possible product type field names: `['Product Type*', 'productType', 'Product Type', 'ProductType']`
- Added fuzzy matching for product names when exact match fails

### 3. Added Fallback Logic
- Added fallback to use `ProductBrand` as vendor when `Vendor` field is empty
- Added proper error handling for missing fields

### 4. Enhanced Product Name Matching
- Added fuzzy matching for product names when exact match fails
- Added logging for match attempts and results

## Test Results
The test script `test_filename_debug.py` shows that:
- Vendor field exists and contains "1555 Industrial LLC"
- Product type field exists and contains "Vape Cartridge"
- Filename generation should work correctly: `AGT_1555_Industrial_Vape_Cartr_VERT_Labels_1TAGS_H_20250718_120000.docx`

## Files Modified
1. **`app.py`** - Enhanced filename generation logic with better debugging and fallbacks
2. **`test_filename_debug.py`** - Created test script to debug filename generation
3. **`FILENAME_GENERATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - This documentation

## Expected Result
After these fixes, the download filename should properly include:
- Vendor name (cleaned for filename compatibility)
- Product type (cleaned for filename compatibility)
- Template type, tag count, lineage, and timestamp

Example: `AGT_1555_Industrial_Vape_Cartr_VERT_Labels_2TAGS_H_20250718_115147.docx`
