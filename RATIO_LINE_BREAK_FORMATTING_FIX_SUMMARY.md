# Ratio Line Break Formatting Fix - Summary

## Issue Description

The user requested that every 2nd space in ratio content should become a new line break. The current formatting was not applying line breaks to ratio content that contained "mg" characters, which prevented proper formatting of cannabinoid content like "10mg THC 30mg CBD 5mg CBG 5mg CBN".

## Root Cause Analysis

**Problem Location**: `src/core/generation/template_processor.py` lines 490-492

**Problem Code**:
```python
if len(cleaned_ratio.split()) > 4 and not any(char in cleaned_ratio for char in ['\n', ':', 'mg']):
```

**Issue**: The condition `not any(char in cleaned_ratio for char in ['\n', ':', 'mg'])` was preventing line break formatting from being applied to any ratio content that contained "mg" characters, which is common in cannabinoid content.

## Solution Implemented

### Removed Restrictive Condition

**File**: `src/core/generation/template_processor.py` lines 490-492

**Before**:
```python
if len(cleaned_ratio.split()) > 4 and not any(char in cleaned_ratio for char in ['\n', ':', 'mg']):
    # Insert a line break after every 2nd space only for longer content
    def break_after_2nd_space(s):
        parts = s.split(' ')
        out = []
        for i, part in enumerate(parts):
            out.append(part)
            if (i+1) % 2 == 0 and i != len(parts)-1:
                out.append('\n')
        return ' '.join(out).replace(' \n ', '\n')
    cleaned_ratio = break_after_2nd_space(cleaned_ratio)
```

**After**:
```python
# Apply line break formatting to all edible ratio content
# Insert a line break after every 2nd space
def break_after_2nd_space(s):
    parts = s.split(' ')
    out = []
    for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        out.append(part)
        if (i+1) % 2 == 0 and i != len(parts)-1:
            out.append('\n')
    return ' '.join(out).replace(' \n ', '\n')
cleaned_ratio = break_after_2nd_space(cleaned_ratio)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Length Restriction**: No longer requires content to have more than 4 words
2. **Removed Character Restrictions**: No longer excludes content with newlines, colons, or "mg" characters
3. **Applied to All Edibles**: Line break formatting now applies to all edible product types
4. **Preserved Classic Type Logic**: Classic types (flower, pre-roll, etc.) still use their own formatting

## Test Results

Created and ran `test_template_ratio_formatting.py` which verifies:

✅ **Edible Products with mg values**:
- Input: `'10mg THC 30mg CBD 5mg CBG 5mg CBN'`
- Output: `'10mg THC\n30mg CBD\n5mg CBG\n5mg CBN'`
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Edible Products with simple content**:
- Input: `'THC 10mg CBD 20mg'`
- Output: `'THC 10mg\nCBD 20mg'`
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Classic Types (no line breaks)**:
- Input: `'THC 10mg CBD 20mg'`
- Output: `'THC 10mg CBD 20mg'` (no line breaks)
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Tinctures (edible types)**:
- Input: `'5mg THC 15mg CBD 2mg CBG'`
- Output: `'5mg THC\n15mg CBD\n2mg CBG'`
- Result: ✅ PASS

## Logic Applied

The line break formatting logic works as follows:

1. **Split content by spaces**: `'10mg THC 30mg CBD 5mg CBG 5mg CBN'` → `['10mg', 'THC', '30mg', 'CBD', '5mg', 'CBG', '5mg', 'CBN']`

2. **Insert newline after every 2nd space**:
   - Word 1: `'10mg'` → add to output
   - Word 2: `'THC'` → add to output, then add `'\n'` (2nd word)
   - Word 3: `'30mg'` → add to output
   - Word 4: `'CBD'` → add to output, then add `'\n'` (4th word)
   - Word 5: `'5mg'` → add to output
   - Word 6: `'CBG'` → add to output, then add `'\n'` (6th word)
   - Word 7: `'5mg'` → add to output
   - Word 8: `'CBN'` → add to output (last word, no newline)

3. **Final result**: `'10mg THC\n30mg CBD\n5mg CBG\n5mg CBN'`

## Files Modified

- `src/core/generation/template_processor.py` - Removed restrictive conditions for ratio line break formatting

## Impact

- **Improved Readability**: Cannabinoid content now displays with proper line breaks
- **Consistent Formatting**: All edible products get consistent line break formatting
- **Preserved Functionality**: Classic types still use their own formatting logic
- **Better User Experience**: Ratio content is now easier to read and understand

## Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Testing the template processor logic directly
2. Confirming line breaks are inserted after every 2nd space
3. Ensuring classic types are not affected
4. Verifying that all edible product types get proper formatting

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Ratio line break formatting now works correctly for all edible products, inserting line breaks after every 2nd space as requested.
