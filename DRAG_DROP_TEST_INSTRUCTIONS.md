# Drag and Drop Reordering Test Instructions

## Overview
The drag and drop functionality has been modified to only allow reordering within the Selected Tags list. Users can no longer drag tags between the Available and Selected lists.

## What's Changed

### Before:
- Users could drag tags from Available → Selected
- Users could drag tags from Selected → Available  
- Users could reorder tags within Selected list

### After:
- Users can ONLY reorder tags within the Selected list
- Drag handles only appear on tags in the Selected list
- Available tags have no drag functionality

## How to Test

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate to the application**:
   - Open browser to `http://127.0.0.1:9090`

3. **Add some tags to Selected list**:
   - Use the checkboxes or buttons to move tags from Available to Selected
   - Make sure you have at least 3-4 tags in the Selected list

4. **Test reordering**:
   - Look for drag handles (⋮⋮⋮ icon) on the left side of tags in the Selected list
   - Hover over a tag to see the drag handle become more visible
   - Click and drag a tag by its drag handle
   - Drop it in a new position within the Selected list
   - Verify the tag moves to the new position

5. **Verify restrictions**:
   - Confirm that Available tags have no drag handles
   - Confirm that you cannot drag tags from Selected to Available
   - Confirm that you cannot drag tags from Available to Selected

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Should Work:
- Reordering tags within Selected list
- Visual feedback during drag (opacity, shadow, rotation)
- Smooth animations
- Haptic feedback on mobile devices
- Drag handles only on Selected tags

### ❌ Should NOT Work:
- Dragging from Available to Selected
- Dragging from Selected to Available
- Drag handles on Available tags

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `static/js/drag-and-drop-manager.js` - Main drag and drop logic
- `static/css/styles.css` - Drag handle styling
- `templates/index.html` - Script inclusion

### Key Changes:
1. **setupTagDragAndDrop()** - Only sets up drag zones for Selected tags
2. **handleDrop()** - Only allows reordering within Selected list
3. **addTagDragIndicators()** - Only adds drag handles to Selected tags
4. **CSS selectors** - Drag handle styles only apply to `#selectedTags`

### New Methods:
- `handleReorder()` - Handles the reordering logic
- `findDropPosition()` - Determines where to insert the dragged element
- `getElementAtDropPosition()` - Finds the target element based on mouse position
- `updateTagOrder()` - Updates the order in TagManager

## Troubleshooting

If drag and drop isn't working:

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify script loading** - Check if drag-and-drop-manager.js is loaded
3. **Check for conflicts** - Ensure no other drag and drop libraries are interfering
4. **Test on different browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
5. **Check mobile devices** - Touch events should work on mobile

## Performance Notes

- Drag and drop uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Mouse position is tracked for precise drop positioning
- Visual feedback is throttled to ~60fps for performance
- Drag handles are only added to Selected tags to reduce DOM overhead
