# Tiered Product Checkboxes Fix

## Problem Description

The tiered product checkboxes in the selected tags list were not visible or functional. The application was creating a hierarchical structure with vendor, brand, product type, and weight sections, each with their own "select all" checkboxes, but these checkboxes were not properly styled and therefore invisible to users.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the CSS styling for the `.select-all-checkbox` class. While the JavaScript was correctly creating the tiered structure with checkboxes, the CSS only defined basic sizing (width: 16px, height: 16px) but was missing the essential styling properties that make checkboxes visible and functional:

- Missing `appearance: none` to override default browser styling
- Missing background color and border styling
- Missing hover and checked state styling
- Missing checkmark content for checked state

## Solution Implemented

Updated the CSS in `static/css/styles.css` to provide complete styling for the `.select-all-checkbox` class:

### Added Properties:
- `appearance: none` - Overrides default browser checkbox styling
- `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)` - Semi-transparent white background
- `border: 2px solid rgba(160, 132, 232, 0.5)` - Purple border matching the theme
- `border-radius: 4px` - Rounded corners
- `cursor: pointer` - Shows pointer cursor on hover
- `transition: all 0.3s ease` - Smooth transitions
- `box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)` - Subtle shadow

### Added Hover State:
- Enhanced background opacity
- Brighter border color
- Enhanced shadow effect

### Added Checked State:
- Gradient background
- Transparent border
- Enhanced shadow
- Checkmark (✓) content with proper styling

## Files Modified

- `static/css/styles.css` - Added complete styling for `.select-all-checkbox` class

## Result

The tiered product checkboxes are now:
- ✅ Visible with proper styling
- ✅ Functional with hover and checked states
- ✅ Consistent with the overall application theme
- ✅ Properly integrated with the hierarchical selection system

## Testing

The fix ensures that users can now:
1. See all tiered checkboxes (vendor, brand, product type, weight levels)
2. Click on any level to select/deselect all items in that category
3. See visual feedback when hovering over checkboxes
4. See clear indication when checkboxes are checked/unchecked

This restores the full functionality of the hierarchical product selection system in the selected tags list.
