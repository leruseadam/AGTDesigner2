# Product Strain UI Match Fix - Summary

## Issue Description

The user requested that the backend CBD Blend/Mixed calculation should be identical to the UI color logic. The backend was using the **Description** field to determine CBD Blend vs Mixed for edibles, while the UI was using the **ProductName** field.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Backend Logic (Before Fix)**:
- Used `self.df["Description"].str.contains(r"CBD|CBG|CBN|CBC", case=False, na=False)` to determine CBD Blend vs Mixed
- This was inconsistent with the UI logic

**UI Logic**:
- Used ProductName field to determine CBD vs Mixed
- If Product Strain is "cbd blend" → Lineage = "CBD"
- If Product Strain is "mixed" → Lineage = "MIXED"
- If Product Name contains CBD/CBG/CBN/CBC → Lineage = "CBD"
- Otherwise → Lineage = "MIXED"

## Solution Implemented

### Changed Backend Logic to Match UI

**File**: `src/core/data/excel_processor.py` lines 1170-1185

**Before**:
```python
# Edibles: if Description contains CBD, CBG, CBN, or CBC, then Product Strain is "CBD Blend", otherwise "Mixed"
edible_cbd_content_mask = (
    self.df["Description"].str.contains(r"CBD|CBG|CBN|CBC", case=False, na=False)
)
```

**After**:
```python
# Edibles: if ProductName contains CBD, CBG, CBN, or CBC, then Product Strain is "CBD Blend", otherwise "Mixed"
edible_cbd_content_mask = (
    self.df["ProductName"].str.contains(r"CBD|CBG|CBN|CBC", case=False, na=False)
)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Field Change**: Changed from `Description` to `ProductName` field
2. **Logic Consistency**: Backend now uses the same field as UI logic
3. **Column Name Fix**: Used `ProductName` instead of `Product Name*` (accounting for column renaming during processing)

## Test Results

Created and ran `test_classic_lineage_alignment.py` which verifies:

✅ **Product Strain Logic Working Correctly**:
- CBD Gummies: Product Strain shows "CBD Blend" (correct)
- CBD Tincture: Product Strain shows "CBD Blend" (correct)
- Non-edibles: Product Strain shows empty (correct for classic types)

✅ **Backend Logic Now Matches UI**:
- Both use ProductName field to determine cannabinoid content
- Both assign "CBD Blend" for products with CBD/CBG/CBN/CBC in name
- Both assign "Mixed" for products without cannabinoid content in name

## Files Modified

- `src/core/data/excel_processor.py` - Updated edible Product Strain logic to use ProductName field

## Impact

- **Consistency**: Backend and UI now use identical logic for determining CBD Blend vs Mixed
- **Accuracy**: Product Strain values now correctly reflect the UI expectations
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for cannabinoid detection logic

## Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Running the test script and confirming Product Strain values are correct
2. Checking debug output shows proper assignment of "CBD Blend" vs "Mixed"
3. Ensuring the logic uses the same field (ProductName) as the UI

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Product Strain calculation now matches UI logic perfectly.
