# Manual Upload "Finalizing upload..." Fix

## Problem Description

Manual file uploads were getting stuck on "Finalizing upload..." message, preventing users from accessing the uploaded data. The issue was occurring in the frontend JavaScript after the backend processing was complete.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `pollUploadStatusAndUpdateUI` function in `static/js/main.js`. After the upload status became 'ready', the frontend was trying to load data but encountering issues:

1. **Race Condition**: The frontend was trying to load data immediately after the backend marked the file as 'ready', but there might have been a timing issue
2. **No Timeout**: The data loading operations had no timeout, so if they failed, the function would hang indefinitely
3. **Poor Error Handling**: If data loading failed, the action splash would remain visible and the user would be stuck

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Delay Before Data Loading
- Added a 500ms delay after clearing cache to ensure backend processing is complete
- This prevents race conditions between backend processing and frontend data loading

### 2. Added Timeout Protection
- Added a 30-second timeout for data loading operations
- If data loading takes longer than 30 seconds, the function will fail gracefully and show an error message

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper error handling for timeout scenarios
- Added user-friendly error messages with toast notifications
- Ensure the action splash is hidden on errors

### 4. Added Completion Feedback
- Added success toast notification when upload processing is complete
- Ensure the action splash is hidden when processing is successful

## Code Changes

### static/js/main.js
- Modified `pollUploadStatusAndUpdateUI` function to add timeout and better error handling
- Added delay before data loading to prevent race conditions
- Added proper cleanup of UI elements on success and error

## Testing

The fixes ensure that:
1. Uploads complete successfully without getting stuck
2. Users receive proper feedback on success and failure
3. The UI is properly cleaned up in all scenarios
4. Timeouts prevent indefinite hanging

## Manual Recovery

If users still experience stuck uploads, they can:
1. Click the "Clear stuck uploads" button in the UI
2. Refresh the page
3. Use the browser console to call `clearStuckUploads()`

## Prevention

The timeout and error handling mechanisms prevent future occurrences of this issue by ensuring that the upload process always completes or fails gracefully within a reasonable time frame.
