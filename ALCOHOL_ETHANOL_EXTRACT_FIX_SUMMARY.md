# Alcohol/Ethanol Extract Product Type Fix

## Summary
Fixed the issue where "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract" was showing as "UNKNOWN TYPE" in the UI by adding proper product type normalization and mapping.

## Problem
- "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract" product types were not being recognized by the system
- They appeared as "UNKNOWN TYPE" in the filter dropdown
- The system was configured for "c02/ethanol extract" but the data contained "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract"

## Root Cause
- The system had `TYPE_OVERRIDES` mapping but it wasn't being applied to normalize product types
- Product types like "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract" weren't mapped to the standardized "c02/ethanol extract" format
- The frontend validation didn't recognize the various alcohol/ethanol extract variations

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Type Mapping (`src/core/constants.py`)
- **Lines 16-25**: Added mappings for alcohol/ethanol extract variations:
  ```python
  "alcohol/ethanol extract": "c02/ethanol extract",
  "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract": "c02/ethanol extract", 
  "alcohol ethanol extract": "c02/ethanol extract",
  "Alcohol Ethanol Extract": "c02/ethanol extract",
  ```

### 2. JSON Matcher (`src/core/data/json_matcher.py`)
- **Lines 17-26**: Added the same mappings to the json_matcher TYPE_OVERRIDES
- **Effect**: Ensures consistent normalization across JSON data processing

### 3. Utils Constants (`src/utils/constants.py`)
- **Lines 13-22**: Added the same mappings to the utils constants
- **Effect**: Ensures consistent normalization across utility functions

### 4. Excel Processor (`src/core/data/excel_processor.py`)
- **Line 25**: Added `TYPE_OVERRIDES` import
- **Lines 750-755**: Added product type normalization step:
  ```python
  # 5.5) Normalize product types using TYPE_OVERRIDES
  if "Product Type*" in self.df.columns:
      self.logger.info("Applying product type normalization...")
      # Apply TYPE_OVERRIDES to normalize product types
      self.df["Product Type*"] = self.df["Product Type*"].replace(TYPE_OVERRIDES)
  ```
- **Effect**: All product types are now normalized during data loading

### 5. Frontend Validation (`static/js/main.js`)
- **Lines 22-25**: Added alcohol/ethanol extract variations to `VALID_PRODUCT_TYPES`:
  ```javascript
  "alcohol/ethanol extract", "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract", 
  "alcohol ethanol extract", "Alcohol Ethanol Extract"
  ```
- **Effect**: Frontend now recognizes these product type variations

### 6. Test File (`test_alcohol_ethanol_fix.py`)
- Created comprehensive test to verify normalization works correctly
- Tests all variations of alcohol/ethanol extract product types
- Confirms they get normalized to "c02/ethanol extract"

## Product Type Normalization Flow

### Before Fix:
1. Data contains: "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract"
2. System doesn't recognize it → Shows as "UNKNOWN TYPE"
3. No formatting applied → Uses default formatting

### After Fix:
1. Data contains: "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract"
2. TYPE_OVERRIDES normalizes to: "c02/ethanol extract"
3. System recognizes as edible type → Gets edible formatting
4. UI shows proper product type name

## Verification

### Test Results:
- ✅ "Alcohol/Ethanol Extract" → "c02/ethanol extract"
- ✅ "alcohol/ethanol extract" → "c02/ethanol extract"  
- ✅ "Alcohol Ethanol Extract" → "c02/ethanol extract"
- ✅ "c02/ethanol extract" → "c02/ethanol extract" (unchanged)
- ✅ "Flower" → "Flower" (unchanged, not in TYPE_OVERRIDES)

### Edible Type Recognition:
- ✅ "c02/ethanol extract" is recognized as edible type
- ✅ Gets same formatting as other edibles (line breaks after every 2nd space)

## Impact
- **Alcohol/Ethanol Extract** products now show proper product type in UI
- **Alcohol/Ethanol Extract** products get the same formatting as edibles
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- **Consistent product type handling** across all data sources
- **Better user experience** with proper product type recognition
