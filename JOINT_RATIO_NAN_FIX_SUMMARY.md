# JointRatio NaN Fix Summary

## Issue Description
JointRatio values were showing as NaN (missing) in the template output for pre-roll products. This occurred when the original Excel file contained NaN values in the "Joint Ratio" column, which were being converted to empty strings during processing, resulting in empty WeightUnits for pre-roll products.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. NaN Value Handling
The system was correctly converting NaN values to empty strings in the JointRatio column during file processing:
```python
# Ensure no NaN values remain in JointRatio column
self.df["JointRatio"] = self.df["JointRatio"].fillna('')
```

### 2. WeightUnits Processing Issue
The problem was in the `_format_weight_units` method in `excel_processor.py`. For pre-roll products with empty JointRatio values, the method was returning an empty string instead of providing a fallback:

```python
# Before fix - returned empty string for missing JointRatio
if pd.isna(joint_ratio) or joint_ratio == 'nan' or joint_ratio == 'NaN' or not joint_ratio:
    result = ""  # Return empty string instead of placeholder
```

This meant that pre-rolls with missing JointRatio data would have empty WeightUnits, causing the JointRatio to not appear in the template output.

## The Fix

### Modified `_format_weight_units` method in `excel_processor.py`

**Before:**
```python
# For pre-rolls and infused pre-rolls, use JointRatio if available
if product_type in preroll_types:
    joint_ratio = safe_get_value(record.get('JointRatio', ''))
    # Handle NaN values properly
    if pd.isna(joint_ratio) or joint_ratio == 'nan' or joint_ratio == 'NaN' or not joint_ratio:
        result = ""  # Return empty string instead of placeholder
    else:
        result = str(joint_ratio)
```

**After:**
```python
# For pre-rolls and infused pre-rolls, use JointRatio if available
if product_type in preroll_types:
    joint_ratio = safe_get_value(record.get('JointRatio', ''))
    # Handle NaN values properly
    if pd.isna(joint_ratio) or joint_ratio == 'nan' or joint_ratio == 'NaN' or not joint_ratio:
        # For pre-rolls with missing JointRatio, try to use Ratio as fallback
        ratio_fallback = safe_get_value(record.get('Ratio', ''))
        if ratio_fallback and ratio_fallback not in ['nan', 'NaN'] and not pd.isna(ratio_fallback):
            result = str(ratio_fallback)
        else:
            # If no fallback available, use a default format based on weight
            weight_val = safe_get_value(record.get('Weight*', ''))
            if weight_val and weight_val not in ['nan', 'NaN'] and not pd.isna(weight_val):
                try:
                    weight_float = float(weight_val)
                    result = f"{weight_float}g x 1 Pack"
                except (ValueError, TypeError):
                    result = ""
            else:
                result = ""
    else:
        result = str(joint_ratio)
```

## How the Fix Works

### Fallback Strategy
1. **Primary**: Use JointRatio if available and valid
2. **Secondary**: Use Ratio field as fallback if JointRatio is missing
3. **Tertiary**: Generate default format using Weight field (e.g., "1g x 1 Pack")
4. **Last Resort**: Return empty string if no fallback data is available

### Benefits
- ✅ Pre-rolls with missing JointRatio data now show meaningful information
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- ✅ Provides multiple fallback options for different scenarios
- ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
Record 1: Test Pre-Roll 2
  JointRatio: '' (type: <class 'str'>)
  WeightUnits: '' (type: <class 'str'>)
  ⚠️  WARNING: JointRatio is empty
  ⚠️  WARNING: WeightUnits is empty for pre-roll
```

### After Fix
```
Record 1: Test Pre-Roll 2
  JointRatio: '' (type: <class 'str'>)
  WeightUnits: '1g x 1 Pack' (type: <class 'str'>)
  ✓ JointRatio fallback working
  ✓ WeightUnits has meaningful value
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/core/data/excel_processor.py`**
   - Modified `_format_weight_units()` method to add fallback logic for missing JointRatio values
   - Added Ratio field as primary fallback
   - Added Weight-based default format as secondary fallback

## Impact

This fix ensures that pre-roll products with missing JointRatio data in the Excel file will still display meaningful weight information in the generated labels, improving the user experience and reducing confusion about missing data.
