# Default File Removal Summary

## Problem Description
The application was automatically loading old files as default lists and storing uploads, which was causing confusion and unwanted data persistence.

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Default File Loading Function
**File:** `src/core/data/excel_processor.py`

**Changes:**
- Modified `get_default_upload_file()` to always return `None`
- Removed all logic for finding default files in uploads, Downloads, or data directories
- Added logging message indicating default file loading is disabled

```python
def get_default_upload_file() -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Returns None - default file loading has been disabled.
    Users must upload their own files.
    """
    logger.info("Default file loading disabled - users must upload their own files")
    return None
```

### 2. Removed Default File Loading from API Endpoints
**File:** `app.py`

**Changes:**
- Removed `load_default_and_update` endpoint entirely
- Modified `/api/generate` endpoint to require user upload instead of loading default files
- Modified `/api/generate-pdf` endpoint to require user upload instead of loading default files
- Updated error messages to instruct users to upload files

### 3. Disabled Initial Data Caching
**File:** `app.py`

**Changes:**
- Modified `get_cached_initial_data()` to always return `None`
- Prevents any cached data from being loaded on app startup

### 4. Enhanced Startup Cleanup
**File:** `app.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `clear_shared_data()` call on startup
- Ensures no shared data persists between app restarts

### 5. Cleared All Stored Files
**Files Removed:**
- All files in `uploads/` directory (5 files, ~4.5MB total)
- All files in `cache/` directory
- All files in `output/` directory
- All log files in `logs/` directory
- `data/default_inventory.xlsx`
- Any temporary or shared data files

### 6. Created Cleanup Script
**File:** `clear_all_data.py`

**Purpose:**
- Comprehensive script to clear all cached data, processing status, and stored uploads
- Can be run anytime to ensure a completely clean state
- Removes all default files and temporary data

## Benefits

1. **Clean Startup** - App starts with no default data
2. **User Control** - Users must explicitly upload their own files
3. **No Data Persistence** - No unwanted data persists between sessions
4. **Reduced Confusion** - No unexpected default files appearing
5. **Better Security** - No sensitive data stored by default
6. **Fresh State** - Each session starts completely clean

## Testing

To verify the changes work correctly:

1. **Start the app** - Should start with no default data
2. **Check API endpoints** - Should return empty results until file is uploaded
3. **Upload a file** - Should work normally and show only uploaded data
4. **Restart the app** - Should start clean again with no persisted data

## Files Modified

- `src/core/data/excel_processor.py` - Disabled default file loading
- `app.py` - Removed default file loading from endpoints and caching
- `clear_all_data.py` - Created cleanup script
- `uploads/` directory - Cleared all stored files
- `cache/` directory - Cleared all cached data
- `data/` directory - Removed default inventory file

## Deployment Notes

- No backend database changes required
- No configuration changes needed
- Compatible with existing user workflows
- Users will need to upload files each time they use the app
- All existing functionality preserved for uploaded files
