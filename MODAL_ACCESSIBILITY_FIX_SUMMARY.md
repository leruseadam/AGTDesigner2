# Modal Accessibility Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing an accessibility violation where `aria-hidden="true"` was being applied to modal elements that contained focusable elements (like close buttons). This violates the WAI-ARIA specification which states that `aria-hidden` should not be used on elements that contain focusable descendants.

**Error Message:**
```
Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. 
The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. 
Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor.
```

## Root Cause

Bootstrap modals use `aria-hidden="true"` on the modal container by default, but when the modal is shown, focus is automatically moved to focusable elements within the modal (like the close button). This creates a conflict where the modal container has `aria-hidden="true"` but contains a focused element.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Modal Event Handling (`static/js/enhanced-ui.js`)

Added proper event listeners for Bootstrap modal events:

```javascript
const modals = document.querySelectorAll('.modal');
modals.forEach(modal => {
  modal.addEventListener('show.bs.modal', function() {
    // Remove aria-hidden when modal is shown
    this.removeAttribute('aria-hidden');
    
    // Store the currently focused element before opening modal
    const activeElement = document.activeElement;
    if (activeElement && !modal.contains(activeElement)) {
      activeElement.setAttribute('data-bs-focus-prev', 'true');
    }
  });
  
  modal.addEventListener('hidden.bs.modal', function() {
    // Restore aria-hidden when modal is hidden
    this.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');
    
    // Ensure focus is moved outside the modal
    const previouslyFocusedElement = document.querySelector('[data-bs-focus-prev]');
    if (previouslyFocusedElement) {
      previouslyFocusedElement.focus();
      previouslyFocusedElement.removeAttribute('data-bs-focus-prev');
    }
  });
});
```

### 2. Manual Modal Handling Updates (`templates/index.html`)

Updated the help modal and emergency cleanup functions to properly manage focus:

- **Help Modal Show**: Store the currently focused element before opening
- **Help Modal Close**: Restore focus to the previously focused element
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Restore focus when forcefully closing modals

### 3. Lineage Editor Updates (`static/js/lineage-editor.js`)

Updated the lineage editor modal to handle focus management:

- Store focus before opening the modal
- Restore focus after closing the modal

### 4. Tags Table Updates (`static/js/tags_table.js`)

Updated the tags table modal handling to include proper focus management.

### 5. Comprehensive Fix Implementation (`templates/index.html`)

Added a comprehensive modal accessibility handling system that:

- **Immediate Setup**: Applies accessibility fixes to existing modals immediately
- **DOM Ready Setup**: Ensures all modals are properly configured when DOM is ready
- **Dynamic Modal Support**: Uses MutationObserver to catch dynamically created modals
- **Event Timing Fix**: Uses `shown.bs.modal` event instead of `show.bs.modal` for proper timing
- **Aria-Hidden Observer**: Additional MutationObserver to watch for and fix aria-hidden violations
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate event listeners
- **Console Logging**: Provides debugging information for troubleshooting

### 6. Script Loading Fix (`templates/base.html`)

Added the enhanced-ui.js script to both index.html and base.html to ensure consistent loading across all templates.

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `static/js/enhanced-ui.js` - Enhanced modal accessibility handling
2. `templates/index.html` - Updated manual modal handling and added comprehensive accessibility fix
3. `templates/base.html` - Added enhanced-ui.js script loading
4. `static/js/lineage-editor.js` - Added focus management to lineage editor
5. `static/js/tags_table.js` - Added focus management to tags table modals

### Accessibility Improvements:
1. **Proper `aria-hidden` Management**: Remove `aria-hidden` when modal is shown, restore when hidden
2. **Focus Management**: Store and restore focus to maintain keyboard navigation flow
3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Ensures screen readers can properly announce modal content
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Maintains proper tab order and focus flow

## Testing

Created two test files to verify the fix works correctly:

1. `test_modal_accessibility.html` - Comprehensive modal accessibility test page
2. `test_accessibility_fix.js` - Console-based test script for debugging

### Test Features:
- Tests basic modal accessibility compliance
- Verifies focus restoration functionality
- Tests multiple modal interactions
- Real-time accessibility violation detection
- MutationObserver functionality testing
- Console-based debugging tools

## Benefits

1. **WCAG Compliance**: Fixes the accessibility violation and improves overall compliance
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Properly announces modal content to assistive technology
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Maintains proper focus flow for keyboard users
4. **User Experience**: Improves accessibility for users with disabilities
5. **Legal Compliance**: Reduces risk of accessibility-related legal issues

## Browser Support

This fix works with all modern browsers that support Bootstrap 5 and the WAI-ARIA specification.

## Future Considerations

1. **Automated Testing**: Consider adding automated accessibility testing to CI/CD pipeline
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor for any new accessibility issues as the application evolves
3. **Documentation**: Keep accessibility guidelines updated for future development
